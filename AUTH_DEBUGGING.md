# Auth System Debugging & Fixes

## Critical Production Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Fake Login Active in Production
**Problem**: `HAS_FAKE_LOGIN` was true in production because `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_EMAIL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_PASSWORD` environment variables were present.

**Root Cause**: The condition `!!(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_EMAIL && process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_PASSWORD)` didn't check if we were in development mode.

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Modified `lib/constants.ts` to only enable fake login in development:
```typescript
export const HAS_FAKE_LOGIN = IS_DEVELOPMENT && !!(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_EMAIL && process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_PASSWORD)
```

### Issue 2: Incomplete Logout Function
**Problem**: `signOut()` only called `supabase.auth.signOut()` but didn't clear localStorage items, leaving stale auth tokens.

**Root Cause**: Both fake login and real auth store tokens in localStorage that weren't being cleared.

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Enhanced `signOut()` function in `lib/auth.ts`:
```typescript
export async function signOut() {
  try {
    // Clear localStorage items
    localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEYS.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN)
    localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEYS.FAKE_USER_SESSION)
    
    // Sign out from Supabase
    await supabase.auth.signOut()
    
    console.log('‚úÖ Successfully signed out and cleared all local storage')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Error during signOut:', error)
    // Even if there's an error, clear local storage
    localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEYS.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN)
    localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEYS.FAKE_USER_SESSION)  
    throw error
  }
}
```

### Issue 3: Auth State Not Properly Reset
**Problem**: The `resetAuth()` function in `use-simple-auth.ts` didn't clear localStorage, leading to inconsistent state.

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Enhanced `resetAuth()` to clear localStorage:
```typescript
function resetAuth() {
    console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] useSimpleAuth: Resetting auth state`)
    
    // Clear any localStorage items
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
        localStorage.removeItem('sb-access-token')
        localStorage.removeItem('fake-user-session')
    }
    
    globalUser = null
    globalLoading = false
    notifySubscribers()
}
```

### Issue 4: Conflicting Auth Systems
**Problem**: When fake login is active, it overrides Telegram authentication, causing the "Sign In" button to show even when logged in via Telegram.

**Root Cause**: The fake login system bypasses Telegram auth flow and creates a different user session.

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Fake login now only works in development mode, so production will use proper Telegram auth.

## Enhanced Debugging

### Added Comprehensive Logging
‚úÖ Enhanced logging throughout the auth system:

1. **Initial session detection**: Shows user ID and profile details
2. **Auth events**: Logs SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT with user details  
3. **Profile fetching**: Shows what profile data is retrieved
4. **Error tracking**: Better error messages for debugging

### Debug Console Output
You should now see detailed logs like:
```
[2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z] useSimpleAuth: Found existing session for user: abc123
[2025-01-01T12:00:00.001Z] getCurrentUserProfile: Found authenticated user: abc123 user@example.com
[2025-01-01T12:00:00.002Z] getCurrentUserProfile: Found profile: John Doe (@johndoe)
[2025-01-01T12:00:00.003Z] useSimpleAuth: Got profile: John Doe (@johndoe)
```

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Deploy and Test Logout
1. Deploy the app to production
2. Sign in with Telegram
3. Verify the auth button shows your profile
4. Click logout
5. Verify you're logged out and the "Sign In" button appears

### 2. Test Auth State Consistency  
1. Sign in with Telegram
2. Hard reload the page
3. Verify you're still logged in as the same Telegram user
4. Check console logs for auth debugging information

### 3. Verify Fake Login is Disabled
1. In production, fake login should not be available
2. Only Telegram login should work
3. Auth button should properly reflect current user

## Production Environment Checklist

- ‚úÖ `HAS_FAKE_LOGIN` only true in development
- ‚úÖ `signOut()` clears all localStorage 
- ‚úÖ `resetAuth()` clears localStorage
- ‚úÖ Enhanced debugging logs
- ‚úÖ Proper auth state management

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these fixes immediately** - they address critical auth issues
2. **Monitor console logs** in production to see the detailed auth flow
3. **Test all auth scenarios**:
   - Login with Telegram ‚úì
   - Logout ‚úì  
   - Page reload after login ‚úì
   - Auth button state consistency ‚úì

The auth system should now work correctly in production! üéâ
